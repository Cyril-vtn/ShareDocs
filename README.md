Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cyril-vtn/ShareDocs.git
cd ShareDocs
```

**Installation**

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

**Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following content:

```env
#Clerk
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up

#Liveblocks
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEBLOCKS_PUBLIC_KEY=
LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY=

#Sentry
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual Clerk & LiveBlocks credentials. You can obtain these credentials by signing up on the [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) and [Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io/) website. </br>
You can also create a [Sentry](https://sentry.io) account but this is not mandatory !

**Running the Project**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project.
